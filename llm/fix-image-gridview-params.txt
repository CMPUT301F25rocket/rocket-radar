> I'm having a problem with my BrowseImageFragment where there is a random 
space being added between rows of the images. Please suggest some possible 
issues. 

● I'll help you investigate the spacing issue in your BrowseImageFragment.
  Let me first locate and read the file to understand the layout.

● Search(pattern: "**/BrowseImageFragment.*")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(src/app/src/main/java/com/rocket/radar/admin/BrowseImageFragment.java)
  ⎿  Read 58 lines

● Search(pattern: "**/fragment_browse_images.xml")
  ⎿  Found 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Search(pattern: "**/ImageAdapter.*")
  ⎿  Found 3 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Read(src/app/src/main/res/layout/fragment_browse_images.xml)
  ⎿  Read 14 lines

● Read(src/app/src/main/java/com/rocket/radar/admin/ImageAdapter.java)
  ⎿  Read 53 lines

● Based on reviewing your code, I can identify several likely causes of the
  random spacing between image rows:

  Possible Issues:

  1. Missing Layout Parameters (Most Likely)

  In ImageAdapter.java:38-39, the ImageView is created programmatically
  without any layout parameters:
  ImageView imageView = new ImageView(parent.getContext());
  Without defined width/height, the ImageView will size itself based on the
  image's natural dimensions, causing inconsistent spacing if images have
  different aspect ratios.

  2. No ScaleType Defined

  The ImageView doesn't have a scaleType set, so images with different
  aspect ratios will render at different heights, creating uneven rows.

  3. Variable Image Dimensions

  If your event banner images have different aspect ratios or sizes, they'll
   display at different heights without proper constraints, causing the
  spacing issue.

  4. No Spacing Control

  There's no ItemDecoration on the RecyclerView and no margin/padding
  defined on the ImageView items to control uniform spacing.

  Suggested Fixes:

  In onCreateViewHolder method, you should:
  - Set explicit LayoutParams with fixed dimensions
  - Set an appropriate scaleType (like CENTER_CROP)
  - Add margin/padding if needed

  Example:
  ImageView imageView = new ImageView(parent.getContext());
  int size = parent.getWidth() / 3; // For 3 columns
  imageView.setLayoutParams(new ViewGroup.LayoutParams(size, size));
  imageView.setScaleType(ImageView.ScaleType.CENTER_CROP);

  Would you like me to implement a fix for this issue?
